# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is the machine learning technique behind the most exciting capabilities in diverse areas like robotics, natural language processing, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, including the famous AlphaGo. In this repository I'll publish my work and courses that I took on Keras 2.0 and Tenserflow 2.1, the latest version of a cutting-edge library for deep learning in Python.

Not long ago, cutting-edge computer vision algorithms couldnâ€™t differentiate between images of cats and dogs. Today, a skilled data scientist equipped with nothing more than a laptop can classify tens of thousands of objects with greater accuracy than the human eye. Here I have used TensorFlow 2.1 to develop, train, and make predictions with the models that have powered major advances in recommendation systems, image classification, and FinTech. I have worked both high-level APIs, which can enable us to design and train deep learning models in 15 lines of code, and low-level APIs, which allow us to move beyond off-the-shelf routines. With Tenserflow I worked on accurately predicting housing prices, credit card borrower defaults, and images of sign language gestures.
